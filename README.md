## Usage

### Frontend:
Navigate to the frontend directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Backend:
Navigate to the server directory and run the Flask application:

```bash
cd server_1
flask run
```

### Streamlit App:
To run the Streamlit interface:

## Features

### 1. **Live Webcam Feed**

- **Webcam Initialization**: Leverages OpenCV for continuous live video feed capture, ensuring real-time interaction.
- **Image Frame Processing**: Processes each frame (BGR format), resizes, flips, and converts to RGB format for AI compatibility.

### 2. **Gesture Control with MediaPipe**

- **Hand Gesture Detection**: Utilizes MediaPipe to detect and track hand gestures in real time with precise hand landmark identification.
- **Landmark Visualization and Extraction**: Draws landmarks on detected hands and extracts their origin coordinates for gesture recognition.

### 3. **Gesture-Based Controls**

- **‚úçÔ∏è Draw Math Problems**: Use the Thumb and Index fingers to draw math problems.
- **üñ± Move Around**: Navigate the screen with Thumb, Index, and Middle fingers lifted.
- **üöº Erase Content**: Activate erase mode with Thumb and Middle fingers to remove unwanted content.
- **üóëÔ∏è Reset Canvas**: Clear the canvas by lifting the Thumb and Pinky fingers.
- **üì§ Send to AI Model**: Submit the drawing for analysis by lifting the Index and Middle fingers.
