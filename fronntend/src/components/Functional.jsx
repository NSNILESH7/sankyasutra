          The "Draw with Mouse or Pad the Equation and Get the Solution" feature
          revolutionizes the way users interact with mathematical problems by
          providing an intuitive, user-friendly interface for solving equations.
          Instead of typing equations into a conventional text box, users can
          simply draw them using a mouse, touchpad, or stylus on a graphical
          input canvas. This feature combines advanced technologies like
          computer vision, optical character recognition (OCR),

          The "Hand Gesture-Based Equation Solver" is a cutting-edge feature
          that leverages OpenCV and computer vision to recognize hand gestures
          via a live camera feed and solve equations in real-time. Instead of
          traditional input methods, users can simply perform predefined hand
          gestures, which are interpreted into mathematical symbols or
          operations. The solution is then displayed instantly, making this a
          unique and interactive approach to solving equations.
